## Hi there 👋
I'm a full-stack web developer with 2 years of experience, currently diving deep into the world of backend development.
My tech stack includes Java, Spring Boot, PostgreSQL, Docker, and Kubernetes.

🛠️ What I Do
Building robust and scalable backend systems with Spring Boot and PostgreSQL.

Containerizing applications using Docker and orchestrating them with Kubernetes.

Learning and experimenting with microservices architecture to build distributed systems.

🌱 What I'm Learning
Exploring microservices and cloud-native development to level up my backend skills.

Trying to understand the magic behind distributed systems and event-driven architectures.

🎮 Fun Stuff About Me
When I'm not coding, you can find me playing board games, jamming to music, or diving into video games.

I believe in balancing work with play, and I’m always up for a good game night!
