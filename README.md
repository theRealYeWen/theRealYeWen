I'm a full-stack web developer with 2 years of experience, currently specializing in backend development.
My expertise includes Java, Spring Boot, PostgreSQL, Docker, and Kubernetes, and I’m passionate about building scalable and efficient systems.

🛠️ What I Do
Design and develop robust, scalable backend systems using Spring Boot and PostgreSQL.

Containerize applications with Docker and orchestrate them using Kubernetes for seamless deployment and management.

Experiment with microservices architecture to build distributed systems that are resilient and maintainable.

🌱 What I'm Learning
Deep diving into microservices and cloud-native development to enhance my backend expertise.

Exploring the principles of distributed systems and event-driven architectures to build more dynamic and scalable solutions.

🎮 Fun Stuff About Me
When I’m not coding, you can find me playing games, listening to music, or diving into video games.

I believe in balancing work with play, and I’m always up for a good game night or a lively discussion about tech and games!
